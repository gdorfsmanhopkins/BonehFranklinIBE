# Boneh-Franklin IBE Scheme Code
Here is an implementation of the Boneh-Frankin identity-based encryption algorithm using Weil pairing, together with an expository paper explaining the math behind the scheme and the implementation.

The ipynb file is a Jupyter notebook with cells implementing the various algorithms in the Weil Pairing IBE using SageMath.  It also has an example runthrough of the entire encryption/decryption process.

The PDF is a mathematical exposition of the process.  The ipynb references the PDF regularly.
